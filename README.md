⚡ About Me

Yo! I'm Soham, a developer based in Kolkata, India.

I bridge the gap between rigorous Quality Assurance and cutting-edge AI Engineering. Currently, I'm ensuring digital excellence at Deloitte USI, but my nights are spent training models and surfing the flow state of Vibe Coding.

I don't just write code; I curate experiences. Whether I'm predicting customer churn with ML or building dashboards that tell a visual story, I bring a unique mix of analytical precision and creative intuition to the table.

🔭 Current Gig: Analytical QA Tester / POC at Deloitte USI.

🌱 Leveling Up: Master's in Computer Applications (2026) & PGP in Data Science (Great Lakes).

🧠 Obsession: Generative AI, LLMs, and making data "talk."

🌊 Philosophy: Vibe Coding. It's about rhythm, intuition, and letting the AI amplify my creativity.
